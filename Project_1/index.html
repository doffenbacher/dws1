		<h2 id="mission">Mission </h2>
			<p> &quot;My focus is on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interconnectedness"> interconnectedness</a>  of all life and how a plant-based diet benefits the earth, non-human animals, and the individual.&quot; </p>
		<h3> When was the last time you talked with someone about your health and received the personal attention you deserve? </h3>
			<p> It’s rare for anyone to get an hour to work on their nutrition and goals with a trained professional. As a Health Coach, I create a supportive environment that will enable you to achieve all of your health goals. I have studied <strong>all the major dietary theories</strong> and use practical lifestyle coaching methods to guide you in discovering which approach works best for you.
				Most approaches to nutrition dwell on calories, carbs, fats, proteins. Instead of creating lists of restrictions and <strong>good</strong> and <strong>bad</strong> foods, I coach my clients to create a happy, healthy life in a way that is flexible, fun and free of denial and discipline.
				No one diet works for everyone. I will guide you to find the food and lifestyle choices that best support you. I will also help you to make gradual, lifelong changes that enable you to reach your current and future health goals.

			<li> I received my training from the <a href="http://www.integrativenutrition.com/home"> Institute for Integrative Nutrition </a>, where I was trained in more than one hundred dietary theories and studied a variety of practical lifestyle coaching methods. Drawing on this knowledge, I will help you create a completely personalized “roadmap to health” that suits your unique body, lifestyle, preferences, and goals.</li>
