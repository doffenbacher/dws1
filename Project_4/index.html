			<p class= "goals" > It’s rare for anyone to get an hour to work on their nutrition and goals with a trained professional. As a Health Coach, I create a supportive environment that will enable you to achieve all of your health goals. I have studied <strong id= "supporting">all the major dietary theories</strong> and use practical lifestyle coaching methods to guide you in discovering which approach works best for you.
				Most approaches to nutrition dwell on calories, carbs, fats, proteins. Instead of creating lists of restrictions and <strong id="good">GOOD</strong> and <strong id="bad">BAD</strong> foods, I coach my clients to create a happy, healthy life in a way that is flexible, fun and free of denial and discipline.
				No one diet works for everyone. I will guide you to find the food and lifestyle choices that best support you. I will also help you to make gradual, lifelong changes that enable you to reach your current and future health goals.
